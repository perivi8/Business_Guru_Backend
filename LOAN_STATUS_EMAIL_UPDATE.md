# 📧 Loan Status Email Update - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 **What's New**

### **Custom Loan Status Email Template**
When admin updates a client's loan status, clients now receive a personalized email with:

**Email Format:**
```
Subject: Your Loan Status Update - TMIS Business Guru

Dear [Client Name],

Your loan status is [STATUS] by admin in TMIS Business Guru

[All client details remain the same as before]
```

## 📋 **Key Features**

### ✅ **For Client Emails (user_email & company_email):**
- **Personalized greeting**: "Dear [Client Name]" (uses legal_name or trade_name)
- **Clear status message**: "Your loan status is [STATUS] by admin in TMIS Business Guru"
- **Highlighted status**: Status appears in colored badge matching the loan status
- **Complete client details**: All existing client information remains unchanged
- **Professional styling**: Same purple header and layout as existing emails

### ✅ **For Team Emails (tmis.* emails):**
- **No changes**: Team continues to receive the same internal notification format
- **Full client details**: Complete information for internal tracking
- **Admin information**: Who made the change and when

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified:**
1. **`production_email_service_enhanced.py`**:
   - Added `_create_loan_status_client_email_template()` method
   - Updated `send_client_update_notification()` to accept `loan_status` parameter
   - Enhanced email routing logic

2. **`email_service.py`**:
   - Updated method signature to pass `loan_status` parameter
   - Maintains backward compatibility

3. **`optimized_status_routes.py`**:
   - Updated loan status update calls to pass `loan_status` parameter

### **New Method:**
```python
def _create_loan_status_client_email_template(self, client_data, loan_status, admin_name):
    """Create HTML email template for loan status updates to clients"""
    client_name = client_data.get('legal_name') or client_data.get('trade_name') or "Client"
    # Creates personalized email with highlighted loan status
```

## 📧 **Email Examples**

### **When Loan Status = "approved":**
```
Dear ABC Business Solutions Pvt Ltd,

Your loan status is APPROVED by admin in TMIS Business Guru

Application Details:
- Legal Name: ABC Business Solutions Pvt Ltd
- Trade Name: ABC Solutions
- Registration Number: REG123456789
- Constitution Type: Proprietorship
- Mobile Number: 9876543210
- Status: Interested (Green badge)
- Loan Status: Approved (Green badge)
- User Email: client@abcsolutions.com
- Company Email: info@abcsolutions.com
```

### **When Loan Status = "hold":**
```
Dear ABC Business Solutions Pvt Ltd,

Your loan status is HOLD by admin in TMIS Business Guru

[Same client details with Orange badge for Hold status]
```

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Trigger Conditions:**
1. Admin updates loan status to: `approved`, `hold`, `processing`, or `rejected`
2. System detects this is a loan status update
3. Sends two types of emails:
   - **Team Email**: Internal notification (unchanged format)
   - **Client Email**: Personalized loan status notification (new format)

### **Email Recipients:**
- **Team**: All users with emails starting with `tmis.`
- **Client**: Both `user_email` and `company_email` (if different)

### **Status Colors:**
- **Approved**: Green (#28a745)
- **Processing**: Blue (#17a2b8)
- **Hold**: Orange (#ffc107)
- **Rejected**: Red (#dc3545)
- **Soon**: Gray (#6c757d)

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Script:**
```bash
python test_loan_status_email.py
```

### **Manual Testing:**
1. **Update loan status** in admin panel
2. **Check emails** for both team and client
3. **Verify personalization**: Client name appears correctly
4. **Verify status**: Loan status is highlighted and colored correctly
5. **Verify details**: All client information is displayed

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ Team receives internal notification (unchanged)
- ✅ Client receives personalized loan status email
- ✅ Email subject: "Your Loan Status Update - TMIS Business Guru"
- ✅ Greeting: "Dear [Client Name]"
- ✅ Status message: "Your loan status is [STATUS] by admin in TMIS Business Guru"
- ✅ All client details displayed correctly
- ✅ Status badges show correct colors

## 📱 **Deployment**

### **Environment Variables (Same as before):**
```bash
SMTP_EMAIL=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
FLASK_ENV=production
RENDER=true
```

### **Deploy Steps:**
1. **Commit and push** all changes
2. **Render auto-deploys** the updated backend
3. **Test loan status updates** in production
4. **Verify emails** are sent with new format

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **For Clients:**
- **Clear communication**: Immediately know their loan status
- **Professional appearance**: Branded email template
- **Complete information**: All their details in one place
- **Personalized**: Addressed by their business name

### **For Team:**
- **No disruption**: Internal emails remain unchanged
- **Full tracking**: Complete audit trail of changes
- **Consistent workflow**: Same process as before

### **For System:**
- **Backward compatible**: Existing functionality unchanged
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more status types
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of email templates

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If clients don't receive loan status emails:**
1. **Check Render logs** for email sending confirmation
2. **Verify client emails** are set in database
3. **Test SMTP configuration** with test script
4. **Check spam folders** for emails

### **If wrong client name appears:**
1. **Check legal_name** field in client data
2. **Fallback to trade_name** if legal_name is empty
3. **Default to "Client"** if both are empty

### **Debug Commands:**
```python
# Test loan status email template
from production_email_service_enhanced import enhanced_email_service
template = enhanced_email_service._create_loan_status_client_email_template(
    client_data, 'approved', 'Admin Name'
)
print(template)
```
