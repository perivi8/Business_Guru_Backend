# Cloudinary Access Control Fix Summary

## Issue
PDF documents uploaded to Cloudinary were showing "Access control: Blocked for delivery" instead of "Public", and PDF previews were not working correctly.

## Root Cause
The code was using the deprecated `access_mode="public"` parameter which is no longer supported by Cloudinary's API. According to Cloudinary's documentation, the `access_mode` parameter has been replaced with the `access_control` parameter.

## Solution
Updated the Cloudinary upload functions in both `client_routes.py` and `enquiry_routes.py` to use the proper `access_control` parameter instead of the deprecated `access_mode` parameter.

## Files Modified

### 1. client_routes.py
- **Location**: `Business_Guru_Backend/client_routes.py`
- **Function 1**: `upload_to_cloudinary()` (lines ~165-197)
- **Function 2**: `copy_business_document_to_client_folder()` (lines ~273-305)
- **Change**: Replaced `access_mode="public"` with `access_control=[{"access_type": "anonymous"}]` for both PDF and non-PDF files

### 2. enquiry_routes.py
- **Location**: `Business_Guru_Backend/enquiry_routes.py`
- **Function**: `upload_to_cloudinary_enquiry()` (lines ~189-219)
- **Change**: Replaced `access_mode="public"` with `access_control=[{"access_type": "anonymous"}]` for both PDF and non-PDF files

## Technical Details

### Before (Deprecated)
```python
result = cloudinary.uploader.upload(
    file,
    # ... other parameters ...
    access_mode="public",  # DEPRECATED - No longer supported
    # ...
)
```

### After (Correct)
```python
result = cloudinary.uploader.upload(
    file,
    # ... other parameters ...
    access_control=[{"access_type": "anonymous"}],  # CORRECT - Ensures public access
    # ...
)
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Public Access**: PDF files will now be uploaded with proper public access control
2. **PDF Preview**: PDF previews should now work correctly in the browser
3. **Compliance**: Uses the current Cloudinary API standards
4. **Consistency**: Applied the fix to all file upload functions in both client and enquiry routes

## Testing

A test script was created (`test_cloudinary_access_fix.py`) to verify:
- Correct parameters are used in both files
- Deprecated `access_mode` parameter is no longer present
- PDF file handling is properly configured
- Cloudinary integration still works
